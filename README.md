# Matlab-Fun
A series of examples written in Matlab, for an unnamed coursework module. The module doesn't change its coursework year on year, so not naming the module means that I won't tempt people who might plagiarise for the course.

Here, there are three examples, which are based on problems which can be modelled in Mathematics

## Magic & Lucky Numbers
Some numbers have special properties. How can we find the most efficient computation-wise solution to checking if a given number is Lucky or Magic?

## Predator & Prey Dynamics
Given a system involving a predator chasing prey around obstacles, how can we model this to determine if their two positions converge in a given time period? What happens if we introduce obstacles, or an exponential decay in speed?
